<p><strong>Isidore Lu</strong> (魯裕源; ルーイジドール), also known professionally as <strong>isid or</strong>, is an American pop musician, visual artist, writer, and computer science student. He is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Music & Technology with a focus in Computer Science at <a href="#">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, with additional minors in Business Administration and Literature & Culture.</p>

<p>Based between San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and New York City, Lu’s work operates at the intersection of pop music, internet culture, media criticism, and technology. His artistic output spans recorded music, visual design, photography, video, social media performance, and long-form cultural writing.</p>

<h2>Early life and education <span class="edit-section">[edit]</span></h2>

<p>Lu studies Music & Technology at Carnegie Mellon University, where his coursework combines conservatory-style music training with rigorous instruction in computer science. His technical background includes systems programming in C, functional programming, computer music in Lisp, backend development in Python (FastAPI), and work with APIs and small-team engineering sprints.</p>

<p>In addition to his major, Lu minors in Business Administration and Literature & Culture. His interdisciplinary training informs a practice that treats pop music not only as sound, but as product, narrative, and cultural artifact. He is expected to graduate in May 2027.</p>

<h2>Artistic practice <span class="edit-section">[edit]</span></h2>

<p>Under the artist project <em>isid or</em>, Lu produces pop music accompanied by a tightly controlled visual identity. The project incorporates dance, photography, video work, graphic design, and social media content as integral components rather than promotional afterthoughts.</p>

<p>He has described an ambition to become “a significant culture figure in the popular art space,” positioning himself within a lineage of pop icons who operate simultaneously as musicians, tastemakers, and aesthetic directors.</p>

<p>Lu maintains an active presence across digital platforms, where he is particularly known for commentary on Charli XCX, J-pop, and contemporary pop discourse. During peak periods, his social media presence has reached approximately one million weekly impressions.</p>

<h2>Media consumption and cultural logging <span class="edit-section">[edit]</span></h2>

<p>A defining feature of Lu’s public persona is the systematic documentation of his media consumption. In 2025 alone, he reported:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reading 40 books</li>
<li>Watching 62 films</li>
<li>Publishing 11 Substack essays</li>
<li>Completing 72 course units</li>
<li>Posting 5 YouTube videos</li>
<li>Attending 45 shows and exhibitions</li>
<li>Releasing 1 song and 1 music video</li>
<li>Completing 1 internship</li>
</ul>

<p>His Goodreads, Letterboxd, Spotify playlists, and Substack (<em>isid core ™</em>) form a publicly accessible archive of influences. This ongoing documentation functions as both self-education and cultural positioning.</p>

<h2>Technology and disillusionment with Silicon Valley <span class="edit-section">[edit]</span></h2>

<p>In 2025, Lu interned at Baobab Studios in San Francisco, contributing to creative AI tools, backend development, and social content within small-team engineering sprints.</p>

<p>Although he gained experience building production-facing tools and working in agile environments, he has expressed skepticism toward what he characterizes as Silicon Valley’s efficiency-driven AI culture. He has publicly questioned certain tradeoffs between artistic merit and technological optimization, describing a growing disillusionment with the startup gold rush surrounding generative AI.</p>

<p>Despite this critique, Lu continues to integrate formal computer science training into creative projects, viewing technical fluency as a lever rather than an identity.</p>

<h2>Writing and <em>isid core ™</em> <span class="edit-section">[edit]</span></h2>

<p>Lu publishes essays and cultural commentary on Substack under the title <em>isid core ™</em>. His writing addresses pop music, internet aesthetics, consumer culture, Asian American identity, literature, and media theory.</p>

<p>The newsletter blends diaristic tone with analytical structure, often framing pop music as both emotional communication and manufactured commodity. It functions as an intellectual extension of the <em>isid or</em> project.</p>

<h2>Geographic positioning <span class="edit-section">[edit]</span></h2>

<p>Lu describes himself as based between San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and New York City, with each city corresponding to a distinct phase of development:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pittsburgh:</strong> academic and technical formation</li>
<li><strong>San Francisco:</strong> immersion in startup and AI culture</li>
<li><strong>New York City:</strong> aspirational center of media, fashion, and cultural production</li>
</ul>

<p>He has expressed particular affinity for New York’s media ecosystem and interest in working at the intersection of journalism, culture, and technology.</p>

<h2>Themes <span class="edit-section">[edit]</span></h2>

<ul>
<li>Pop stardom as constructed identity</li>
<li>Consumerism as aesthetic language</li>
<li>East Asian and Western pop hybridity</li>
<li>Media logging as self-formation</li>
<li>The tension between art and optimization</li>
<li>Cultural ambition in the age of algorithms</li>
</ul>
