         <strong>LETTER TO TYLER BAINBRIDGE</strong>
<br>
<br>
         </p>

         <p style="text-align:left;max-width:40em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
Hi Tyler!
<br>
<br>
My name is Isidore, and I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Music & Technology with a Focus in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I’ve been meaning to reach out for a while but wanted make sure I knew what to say. Basically I'm just a humongous fan of the vision behind PI and would desperately love to be a part of building it in NYC.
<br>
<br>
The space seems almost too perfect, pun unintended, for the the eclectic background I carry with me. My major encompasses both rigorous computer science and music training in the Western conservatory style, and my minors are in Business Administration and Literature & Culture. However, these are only supplemental to my true passions that live outside the academic space.
<br>
<br>
I firstly am an avid fan of art, culture, and entertainment media, and I dream of one day becoming a significant culture figure in the popular art space via the path of a pop musician. I make music and dance through my artist project isid or, where I also output visual design work, photography, video, and social media content. I average around a million impressions on Twitter every week as a top tweeter on Charli xcx and J-pop and read about three to four novels every month. I like to go out and watch films (anywhere between five to ten in a month), and I make it a point to go out to events and shows regularly. But alas, in thinking about what can sustain me financially after graduation in May 2027, I have trouble finding something appropriate.
<br>
<br>
San Francisco last summer, with my time at the tech-animation studio Baobab, informed me of what I was weak at and what I didn’t want. Although I learned a lot from building creative AI tools in small-team engineering sprints and creating social content, I found the efficiency-driven culture of Silicon Valley inhibiting, even in an animation studio. It was hard to keep up in agile development, which I partially attribute to inexperience, and I found certain tradeoffs made regarding artistic merit to be questionable. In general, I’ve become quite disillusioned with San Francisco’s vision of AI in the recent months after being immersed in the AI startup gold rush and its daily developments. I met a lot of extremely driven young people in the scene, one of whom offered me $100k comp to take a gap and do marketing for them in NYC, but I realized that maybe the lack of alignment in what we find important would ultimately have its toll.
<br>
<br>
However, that’s not to say I have turned down tech development entirely. In fact, I think that, given my toils through CMU’s intensive computer science curriculum over the last four years, I should leverage those skills in any case. The courses I’ve enjoyed include a comprehensive computer systems course taught in C. I’m currently taking functional programming and a computer music course taught in Lisp. The classes I have yet to take include Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms and two CS electives of my choice. Baobab also gave me experience implementing FastAPI backend in Python and working with APIs. Although I feel software engineering is not my strong suit, I definitely have a solid background and formal training that I’m willing to put to use to get my foot in bigger doors.
<br>
<br>
This brings me to why I’m so drawn to PI. Through seeing it evolve since the “Cool Kids” article in 2022, I’ve only become more enamored by the vision. I remember ideating my capstone in sophomore year and wanting to create what would essentially be exactly the same as what would come out in January 2024 as PI.FYI. I think it can get me in front of a lot of important faces. I think it can allow me to fuse my tech knowledge and media passion. I think it can be a space in which I can grow and be inspired. I also just love New York.
<br>
<br>
And thus, here’s what I can offer you. I’m open to any role. I can wear many hats, which I know is important for small startups, and am someone who’s passionate, driven, and attentive. My reputation in time management precedes me. I’m familiar with the tradeoffs of business and art. I know the jargon and rhythm of small-team startups, and I have a foundation in tech development. I also have experience in (and an undying love for) the arts. I have an interest in media journalism but have limited experience. I know how to build engagement through content and am incredibly tapped in. That latter is probably the most appropriate for Perfect Imperfect. I have quite good taste.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading through. Sorry if this was a lot. I can be pretty dramatic. But if you’re down, I would love to meet and chat sometime! I will be in NYC for my spring break from Tuesday 3/3 afternoon to Saturday 3/7 evening. I’m also willing to help out at PI remotely without any comp whenever. I am, as I mentioned at the beginning, just a huge fan.
